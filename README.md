## Python Key Logger

This repository contains a simple Python key logger that uses the pynput package. It is based [quite heavily] off of a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCirPbvoHzD78Lnyll6YYUpg) by [attreyabhatt](https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Python-Keylogger).

This key-logger differs from his as it has all of his non-character key conditions coded in as well as a special backspace function that, when hit, removes the last character typed by the user/victim. This produces a relatively clean looking output log file.
